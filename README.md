# Airflow-data-Pipline
 This project demonstrates an Apache Airflow data pipeline for loading employee data from an S3 bucket to Snowflake. The pipeline automates the process of extracting data from PostgreSQL, uploading it to S3, joining and detecting new or changed rows, and finally loading the data into Snowflake.
